City Rat : visualizing NYC rat sighting data

Description
Our project takes data that is reported to 311 in NYC about rat sightings in their area. 
From here we took this date and created a data set that looked at date called into 311 for the report and frecency of sightings for each borough in NYC. 
The rat shows users the data by a button pressed feature on the foot which calls the array and moves the servos and the DC motors in motions to 
indicate which borough has the most amout of rat sighting in that day. 
Our big goal is to have many of these data visualizion in diffent cities linked to how many animals sightings are reported to create awarness of wildlife within cities.
