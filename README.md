City Rat: visualizing NYC rat sighting data

Description
Our project takes data reported to 311 in NYC about rat sightings in their area. 
From here we took this data and created a data set that looked at the date called into 311 for the report and frecency of sightings for each borough in NYC. 
The rat shows users the data by a button-pressed feature on the foot which calls the array and moves the servos and the DC motors in motion to 
indicate which borough has the most amount of rat sightings on that day. 
Our big goal is to have many of these data visualizations in different cities linked to how many animal sightings are reported to create awareness of wildlife within cities.
